# zkorage

**Verifiable claims on Stellar.** Prove a quantitative or boolean fact about *private, attested data*
(e.g. "reserves ≥ supply", "KYC-passed & not sanctioned", "revenue ≥ $X") **without revealing the
data** — and let anyone verify it **on-chain** on Soroban.

Engine: **RISC Zero zkVM → Groth16 (BN254) → bare on-chain `Groth16Verifier`** (rebuilt on
`soroban-sdk 26.1.0`). An ed25519-signed claim envelope from a trusted attester is checked *inside*
the zkVM guest, which also asserts the predicate; the proof is wrapped to Groth16 and verified by a
native BN254 pairing check on Stellar. The prover is **self-hosted** (the only party that ever sees the
private witness).

> Hackathon project — **Stellar Hacks: Real-World ZK**. The verifier is **unaudited; demo only.**

## Status — the full build is complete (testnet)
Weeks 1–8 (below) **and** the post-week-8 **Confidential Data Room (DR1–DR6)** are built, deployed, and
self-tested on Stellar testnet. The Data Room has since been redesigned into one anonymous model (internally
**Model B**): a policy-gated committee document you open by proving anonymous membership, with keys derived
from your wallet so you open on any device. It adds a public discovery directory and, in its load-bearing
slice, a timing defense that batches and shuffles the on-chain access records, so the room sees that an
approved member accessed in a window, not which member or exactly when. The Data Room now also supports
**Bonded Access**: a room now uses one access model, set by the owner in a new **Room Management** tab, either
approved membership or a bond anyone can lock. In bonded-access mode the owner sets a requirement (a token, a
minimum amount, a deadline) and anyone who locks a qualifying non-revocable bond opens the room's documents
**with no approval and no member list**. The reader proves the bond without revealing which wallet, which lock,
or the exact amount; the proof carries its own key, so the 2-of-3 keeper committee seals the document key to it
directly. Privacy needs at least three qualifying bonders for a requirement. Frontend is **v0.12.64**. A
**Bonded Proofs** pillar (a Soroban-native time-locked escrow plus two
live ZK products: a **solvency proof that dies when you pull your collateral** and a **standalone Bonded
Access tier**) is also live; see below. The standalone Bonded Access tier now takes **any wallet token** for
its requirement (token, amount, deadline), and its anonymous handle is **wallet-synced** (encrypted under a
wallet signature so it follows your wallet, not your browser). Proving runs **in the background** (the backend
finishes and submits the proof, so you can leave the page), the access you hold is listed in a **Your access**
tab, and each grant has a shareable link to a public **`/verify/bond`** page that re-reads `is_granted`
on-chain. The whole stack
runs on **RISC Zero 5.0.0-rc.1** (GPU proving on a self-hosted box, with a CPU fallback). The frontend is a
single unified app — a **public marketing site** (`/` — landing, documentation, verify, explorer) plus a
**sidebar app** (`/app/*`) in the "Precision Ink" design system. The app nav now focuses on the **Data Room**
and **Bonded Proofs**, with a read-only **Contracts** reference page; the five standalone proofs stay reachable
by URL.

**Live demo:** the app runs at **https://zkorage.wazowsky.id** (API at `https://apizk.wazowsky.id`), on
Stellar testnet. Connect **Freighter** (top right) to sign and submit your own proof transactions and pay
your own gas. Without a wallet, the backend relays every flow. Verification needs no wallet either way.

- **Bare Groth16 verifier (current):** `CBAPC663PTWIWDLYNCG5WAD5MIZF4SKY43U6L2NM5ZUU5XFOS4JDYAFW`
  (selector `ef6cb709`, RISC0 `5.0.0-rc.1`). The Week-1 ID below (`CB75PMLN…`, params 3.0.0) was the
  original — during the **3.0.5 → 5.0.0-rc.1 migration** (to unblock GPU proving) all 8 guests were rebuilt
  and all 7 policy/gate contracts were re-pinned in place. Full record: `contract/deployment.testnet.json`.

## Layout
```
contract/   Soroban (Rust): bare RISC0 Groth16Verifier (sdk 26.1.0) + demo SEP-41 token + PoR policy.
prover/     RISC Zero zkVM guest + host (builds/runs on an x86 + Docker box, not Windows).
backend/    Node/TS orchestration API: mock custodian attester + prover proxy + on-chain verify/submit + REST.
frontend/   Vite + React + TS (Tailwind + shadcn, "Precision Ink"). Marketing site (/) + sidebar app (/app/*).
sdk/        zkorage-sdk: read-only, trust-minimized TS SDK (query + re-verify claims on the public chain).
mcp/        zkorage-mcp: read-only MCP server (agent tools) over the SDK. No key custody.
keyper/     DR3 threshold-ECIES keyper committee (3 services; 2-of-3 Shamir split of each Data Room doc key).
```

## Week 1 status — the spine is live on testnet
- **Verifier deployed (testnet):** `CB75PMLNOMDATZ7BMEYYJMQUEMPUIVZKBGMAHZKDJH6BBG57LI6DZ2JH`
  (selector `73c457ba`, RISC0 params `3.0.0`, WASM 15.9 KiB).
- On-chain `verify()` cost ≈ **30.3M CPU instructions** (~30% of the ~100M budget).
- A real RISC0 3.0.0 Groth16 proof verifies on-chain; tampered seal / tampered journal are rejected.

## Week 2 status — Proof-of-Reserves MVP live on testnet
An issuer proves **reserves ≥ circulating supply** without revealing the reserve figure; the supply is
bound on-chain to a real SEP-41 token's `total_supply`, and the result is verified + persisted.
- **Demo SEP-41 token (`zUSD`, 7 dp):** `CC3JKNC4EKALMT7WALUMCTVBSH73ZZSP3AC4B7IQUAZ7UYYZCEIISQLA`
- **PoR policy:** `CCXIEYFULSORMXN3AW5ZK4DLRANLSCRMROBEFEAWF3CL6MZ3YWSYQCMT`
  (pins the canonical guest image_id, recomputes `sha256(journal)` on-chain, cross-calls the bare
  verifier, then asserts `journal.supply == token.total_supply()` and persists).
- **Canonical guest image_id** (deterministic Docker build): `5bb5644b…d1e76ce2`.
- `submit_proof_of_reserves` ≈ **0.04 XLM**. Acceptance: valid → persisted; supply mismatch → `#10`;
  tampered → `#5`; `R<S` → guest panics (no receipt). Browser e2e via Playwright.

## Week 3 status — verification channels (history + public verify page + REST API)
A verified claim is now **independently checkable by anyone, without trusting our server**, three ways:
- **On-chain, append-only history.** The policy was **redeployed** (now **upgradeable**) with an
  append-only log: `get_count` / `get_by_index` / `get_history(start,limit)`; each `VerifiedResult`
  carries an `index`. Events expire (~7 days) so the on-chain log is the durable record.
  - **PoR policy (Week 3):** `CDQ2PA27UTJDLPA4XTGG647SNTMUYO2KRFGS3SW5SMNBIWRB7JVCZXQ6`
    (admin-gated `upgrade()` → in-place WASM swap; supersedes the Week-2 policy `CCXIEYFUL…QCMT`).
- **Documented REST API.** `backend/` adds `/count`, `/history`, `/result/:issuer`, a shareable
  `/audit/:issuer` bundle, an independent re-verify `POST /audit/verify` (→ a ✓/✗ checklist), an
  embeddable `/badge.svg`, and an **OpenAPI spec** at `/openapi.yaml` + Swagger UI at `/docs`.
- **Public "verify it yourself" page** (`/verify/:issuer`, no wallet). It recomputes `sha256(journal)`,
  checks the image-id pin, then asks the **public** verifier/policy/token contracts (directly, via a
  public RPC — not our backend) to confirm the Groth16 proof and the supply binding, and shows the
  exact `stellar contract invoke` commands to reproduce every check. Plus an `/explorer` of the
  on-chain history.

### Verify it yourself (no zkorage server)
```bash
# 1) Read the persisted result + history straight from the chain:
stellar contract invoke --id CDQ2PA27UTJDLPA4XTGG647SNTMUYO2KRFGS3SW5SMNBIWRB7JVCZXQ6 \
  --network testnet --source <any-funded-account> -- get_latest_result
stellar contract invoke --id CDQ2PA27UTJDLPA4XTGG647SNTMUYO2KRFGS3SW5SMNBIWRB7JVCZXQ6 \
  --network testnet --source <any> -- get_history --start 0 --limit 10

# 2) Re-verify the Groth16 proof against the public verifier (bundle from GET /audit/latest):
stellar contract invoke --id CB75PMLNOMDATZ7BMEYYJMQUEMPUIVZKBGMAHZKDJH6BBG57LI6DZ2JH \
  --network testnet --source <any> -- verify --seal <hex> --image_id 82bbf7ee… --journal <sha256(journal)>
```

## Week 4 status — TypeScript SDK + read-only MCP server
A verified claim is now **agent- and developer-consumable** — query + re-verify it with no keys and no
trust in our server.
- **`zkorage-sdk`** (`sdk/`): read-only, env-agnostic (Node + browser). Trustless on-chain reads
  (`getLatestResult`, `getHistory`, `getCount`, …), a full Groth16 re-verify (`verifyBundle` →
  9-check verdict against the public verifier), and the headline `isReservesGteSupply(issuer?)`.
  Testnet contract IDs baked in. `cd sdk && npm i && npm run smoke` → all green vs live testnet.
  **It is the single verification implementation** — the backend, the `/verify` page, and the MCP
  server all use it, so **build it first** (`cd sdk && npm i && npm run build`); backend + frontend
  consume it via `file:../sdk`.
- **`zkorage-mcp`** (`mcp/`): a **read-only MCP server** (stdio) exposing the SDK as agent tools —
  `is_reserves_ge_supply`, `get_history`, `verify_proof_bundle`, … — with **no key custody**. Self-test:
  `cd mcp && npm i && npm run build && npm run selftest` (a programmatic MCP client calls every tool).
  Wire it into Claude Desktop/Code via the snippet in `mcp/README.md`.
- **Frontend `/developer`**: dogfoods the SDK live in the browser (runs `isReservesGteSupply()` +
  `verifyBundle()` against the public RPC) + SDK/MCP quickstarts + OpenAPI link.

**Acceptance:** an MCP client asks *"is issuer X's reserves ≥ supply?"* → on-chain-verified answer
(`answer:true, fresh:true`), and `verify_proof_bundle` re-verifies the Groth16 proof (`verdict:true`) —
all with no keys held server-side.

## Week 5 status — KYC selective disclosure (identity gate) live on testnet
A user proves they are **KYC-verified by an allow-listed provider — without revealing their identity**,
and the proof grants on-chain access to a chosen Stellar account. The KYC provider signs a credential
containing the subject's identity; the zkVM proves "`kyc = passed` by an allow-listed issuer" while the
`subject_id` **stays private** (it is never committed to the journal). A second, accessor-bound guest +
a **relying-party gate** contract make this a second use-case on the same engine.
- **KYC gate:** `CCTHDSEQFMAOPJXI5GVSUTMXO5DHZUJS7YQYAEIGKFMOAMTNDKSL4FWT` — pins the canonical identity
  guest image_id, recomputes `sha256(journal)` on-chain, cross-calls the bare verifier, checks the
  identity policy (result, `claim_type=3`, allow-listed KYC issuer, freshness), then **grants access to
  the public `accessor`** the proof is bound to (append-only history; `is_granted` / `get_access`).
- **Identity guest image_id** (deterministic Docker build): `99e3fdb8…2d810ac2`. The 85-byte journal
  commits `{result, claim_type, issuer_id, accessor, nonce, expiry}` — **`subject_id` is absent**.
- **Not redirectable** without a nullifier: `accessor` is fixed inside the proof, so re-submitting a
  bundle only ever grants the accessor the holder chose. (Note: `accessor` is *not* authenticated by
  the proof — a grant proves a valid KYC credential exists and its holder chose this accessor, not
  that the accessor's owner is the subject; nullifier + accessor-auth are deferred to Week 6+.)
- **Soundness fix (this week):** the shared guest now asserts `pk == issuer_id` (the committed issuer
  must be the key that actually signed). This changed the **PoR guest image_id → `82bbf7ee…1c6f3d54`**;
  the live PoR policy was re-pinned in place (`set_image_id`) and a fresh PoR proof re-submitted.
- **SDK + MCP** gained the identity surface: `isKycVerified(accessor)`, `getAccess`, `getAccessHistory`,
  `verifyIdentityBundle`, and the MCP tools `is_kyc_verified`, `get_access`, `get_access_history`,
  `verify_identity_bundle`. **Frontend `/identity`** drives the prove → grant → relying-party flow.

**Acceptance:** a KYC'd user is granted access (no identity on-chain — `subject_id` never appears); an
un-granted account, a non-allow-listed issuer (`#8`), a tampered seal (`#5`), a wrong image (`#3`), and
a *failed* KYC (guest panics → no receipt) are all denied.

## Week 6 status — Compliance (KYC ∧ not-sanctioned) live on testnet
A user proves they are **KYC-verified AND not in a sanctions deny-list — in one proof, identity hidden**,
and the proof grants on-chain access to a chosen account. A single combined guest verifies the KYC
credential **and** proves the (private) `subject_id` is absent from a sanctions deny-list via a
**SHA-256 Indexed-Merkle-Tree non-membership** path, committing only the deny-list **root** (which the
gate pins). Because both predicates run in one guest, they bind to the **same** hidden identity.
- **Compliance gate:** `CDSA3PUL7OZ5HKLIT73ZTG64TLYK4QTO5ZHZKHA3JBS76R5L5Q2EO4FV` — like the KYC gate
  plus a pinned **`deny_root`**; `request_access` adds `deny_root == Config.deny_root` (`#11`
  `DenyRootMismatch`). `is_granted` re-checks both expiry **and** the deny-root, so an admin
  `set_deny_root` (a new sanction) **immediately revokes** stale grants.
- **Compliance guest image_id** (deterministic Docker build): `eba31f8e…21005916`. The 117-byte journal
  commits `{result, claim_type=4, issuer_id, deny_root, accessor, nonce, expiry}` — **`subject_id` is absent**.
- **Why SHA-256, not Poseidon:** RISC0 has a sha256 precompile, so a depth-20 non-membership path is
  ~1 segment (combined proof ≈ 2 segments / ~12 min on CPU); Poseidon-BN254 measured ~28 segments (no
  BN254 field precompile in the zkVM). The gate compares roots only (no on-chain hashing), so the hash
  is a sound off-chain↔guest choice. The deny-list (a Soroban contract pins the root; the backend
  `denylist.ts` IMT builder is the off-chain authority) holds a few mock sanctioned identities.
- **SDK + MCP** gained the compliance surface: `isCompliant(accessor)`, `getComplianceAccess`,
  `getComplianceHistory`, `verifyComplianceBundle`, and the MCP tools `is_compliant`,
  `get_compliance_access`, `get_compliance_history`, `verify_compliance_bundle`. **Frontend
  `/compliance`** drives the prove → grant → relying-party flow (pick "Mallory" for the sanctioned ✗).

**Acceptance:** a KYC'd & not-sanctioned user is granted (identity never on-chain); a **sanctioned**
subject cannot produce a non-membership proof (no receipt); a stale `deny_root` (`#11`), a tampered seal
(`#5`), a wrong image (`#3`), and a failed KYC (no receipt) are all denied. Adversarial review **SOUND**;
Codex review **clean**. The prover is **worker-first for all kinds** (multi-core worker when online, multi-core
VM fallback), both emitting the contract-pinned image_ids.

## Week 7 status — Confidential payroll (proof-of-income + auditor view-key) live on testnet
An employee proves **"paid ≥ a threshold"** while the **salary stays fully private** — the contracted
figure is confidential between employee and company. The guest verifies an attester-signed payroll
record, asserts `salary ≥ threshold`, and **encrypts the salary in-guest to an allow-listed auditor's
x25519 key** (ECIES). The public sees only `✓ paid ≥ X` + an opaque ciphertext; an **auditor's view
key** unlocks the exact figures — *provably the signed salary* (the proof binds the ciphertext).
- **Payroll gate:** `CA6XYNHYR3GS3TQ24Z2Y45SXRNQDA5Z4L2PU54YM2WUKSMPVWVMYZCDA` — like the KYC gate
  (claim_type 5) plus an **auditor-key allowlist**; `submit_payroll_proof` adds `auditor_pub ∈ allowlist`
  (`#11` `AuditorNotAllowed`) and stores the disclosure (`eph_pub`/`ct`/`tag`) in each grant. It only
  RECORDS the cleared threshold — no on-chain "market rate" (the rate is confidential). Reuses the bare
  verifier (no redeploy).
- **Payroll guest image_id** (deterministic Docker build): `b9c97e6b…f0a9432f`. The 229-byte journal
  commits `{result, claim_type=5, issuer_id, threshold, accessor, auditor_pub, eph_pub, ct(40), tag(32),
  nonce, expiry}` — **the salary is absent**.
- **Auditor disclosure (Option B — in-guest ECIES):** `eph_pub = X25519(eph, BASE)`,
  `shared = X25519(eph, auditor_pub)`, a sha256 counter-mode keystream encrypts `salary‖blinding`, and
  `tag = sha256(DOMAIN_TAG ‖ salary ‖ blinding)` gives the auditor a definitive "faithful ✓" after
  decrypt (and detects a wrong key). The in-guest X25519 was **measured at ~3 segments** (the curve25519
  precompile accelerates it — no Poseidon-style blowup). The salary never leaves the prover in clear.
- **SDK + MCP** gained the payroll surface: `isIncomeVerified(accessor)`, `getPayrollAccess/History`,
  `verifyPayrollBundle`, `openPayrollDisclosure(accessor, viewKey)` (pure, key-free — the SDK never
  custodies a key), and the MCP tools `is_income_verified`, `get_payroll_access`, `get_payroll_history`,
  `verify_payroll_bundle`. **Frontend `/payroll`** drives the employee prove→grant flow + an auditor view
  that unlocks per-employee salaries + the payroll total (each with a faithful badge).

**Acceptance:** an employee is income-verified with the salary hidden (only the boolean + ciphertext are
public); the **auditor** unlocks the exact salary (6000) + the deduped payroll total via the view key
(faithful ✓), a **wrong key** yields faithful ✗, a salary below the threshold produces no receipt, a
tampered seal is denied (`#5`), and a non-allow-listed auditor is denied (`#11`). Adversarial review
**SOUND**; code review APPROVE; a 2nd deeper pass added `/payroll/audit` full-log pagination + a
frontend/gateway hardening; **Codex review clean**. `submit_payroll_proof` ≈ 0.037 XLM.

## Week 8 status — Fundraising (the composition finale) live on testnet
A fundraise admits an investor **only by proving BOTH** — (a) they are an **accredited investor** (an
identity-style proof; identity hidden) **AND** (b) the fundraise has **revenue ≥ X** (a value≥threshold
financial proof; the real revenue hidden). Two independent ZK proofs about two **different** parties,
**AND'd on-chain**. This is the same engine as every other page — composed.
- **Accredited gate:** `CCLSXZBOPCAJQS6L54EAGZQHTD5QUES2OSYCFX5XJT6ZXSICRPS4QKQZ` — a faithful clone of
  the KYC gate (`claim_type=7`), grants an "accredited = yes" credential to an `accessor`; identity hidden.
  **Accredited guest image_id** `04fe8d3e…54cd66ab` (deterministic Docker build; NEW-2 domain-separated
  signature `zkorage-accredited-v1\0`).
- **Fundraise contract:** `CDEV4METH74Z42DFV6HC3VLF3PWACXVIIS7C3PLK6CZT2B6L5I3YBC2L` — ingests the
  revenue proof itself (`submit_revenue_proof`: the **generic PoR guest** `82bbf7ee…` reused for
  `claim_type=6`, binds the proven floor `== X` and the auditor allowlist), then
  `request_investor_access(accessor)` = the **AND**: `is_revenue_verified()` (freshness- + X-consistent)
  **cross-calls** the accredited gate's `is_granted(accessor)` (`try_is_granted`, fail-closed) → admits.
  `can_access` is the live read of the same AND. Both legs drop when either proof/credential expires.
  `request_investor_access` ≈ **0.017 XLM**. Demo `X = $1,000,000`.
- **SDK + MCP (v0.8.0)** gained the composition surface: `isAccredited(accessor)`,
  `isFundraiseRevenueVerified()`, **`canAccessFundraise(accessor)`** (the composed AND, on-chain),
  `verifyAccreditedBundle` / `verifyRevenueBundle`, and the MCP tools `is_accredited`,
  `can_access_fundraise`, `get_fundraise_info`, `verify_accredited_bundle`, `verify_revenue_bundle`.
  **Frontend `/fundraise`** drives the company prove-revenue + investor prove-accredited flows and shows
  the composition banner (per-leg ✓/✗ → ACCESS GRANTED/DENIED).

**Acceptance:** only a **proven-accredited** investor can access a fundraise that **proves revenue ≥ X** —
both required. Negatives: accredited-but-no-revenue → `#11 RevenueNotVerified`; revenue-but-not-accredited
→ `#12 NotAccredited`. Verified live on testnet (positive + both negatives + a full backend e2e for a fresh
investor). **Two review passes:** adversarial **SOUND** (no Critical/High) + code review **Ship-it** —
7 fixes applied (incl. `try_is_granted` totality, revenue X-consistency, MCP env overrides, an empty-input
guard, a fail-closed worker job-build); the fundraise was upgraded in-place. **Codex review CLEAN.** The
8-week build is complete and reviewed.

## Confidential Data Room (post-Week-8 — DR1–DR6) live on testnet
A confidential document room built on the same engine. The marquee load-bearing ZK is **anonymous
eligibility**: you get into a room **only by proving you're on its approved list, without revealing which
member you are, and only once** (a per-room nullifier). DataRoom contract
`CDUQITRVJOPJNVWBUINLZFI2LHPOLVFW2I7354WEFDG2W3VIG627HLNN` (upgraded in place across DR1–DR6):
- **DR1 — store a document:** encrypt a file, keep it private, post only a tamper-evident fingerprint
  on-chain; an in-guest ECIES seal binds a per-doc key to a recipient's x25519 key.
- **DR2 — get in anonymously ⭐:** depth-20 SHA-256 Merkle membership over a per-room approved-set root +
  a per-room nullifier; identity is absent from the record (the load-bearing ZK).
- **DR3 — release the key:** each per-doc key is **Shamir-split 2-of-3** across an independent keyper
  committee (`keyper/`) — no single server holds it; the recipient collects ≥2 sealed shares and
  reconstructs + decrypts client-side.
- **DR4 — prove a signed fact:** re-verify a real **RSA-2048** issuer signature **inside the zkVM** and
  prove "value ≥ threshold" about the signed statement without revealing it (allow-listed issuer key).
- **DR5 — share a masked copy:** prove a fact about a sealed document and hand an auditor a redacted copy
  that's provably the genuine file.
- **DR6 — meet all conditions:** admit someone only if they satisfy a composite policy
  (member ∧ KYC ∧ accredited ∧ not-sanctioned), each an independent proof AND'd on-chain; plus surgical
  per-accessor revocation and committee key rotation.
- **Pattern 2, open a shared document (per-document self-serve access):** an owner attaches a per-document
  policy (member, KYC, accredited) to a committee document; a reader proves it anonymously, the 2-of-3
  keepers release the key to their proof-bound key, and they decrypt in-browser. On-chain `set_doc_policy` /
  `is_doc_admitted` / `get_doc_policy` (additive upgrade, no new guest); the keepers gate share release on
  `is_doc_admitted`. The owner side also gained a Documents submenu, a "Browse = rooms your wallet owns"
  view (on-chain ownership), and dropped the redundant contents column.

The SDK/MCP gained the read-only Data Room surface (no key custody); the frontend `/app/dataroom`
drives all of it. Reviewed clean across the slices (adversarial SOUND + code-review Ship-it).

### Model B — the current shape (anonymous-only, sign-to-derive, timing-defended)
The slices above are the engine. The Data Room is now presented as ONE model so the anonymity claim is
unambiguous. A room owner curates members by request-then-approve: joining is by name, accessing is anonymous.
Any approved member opens a document by proving anonymous membership, and the 2-of-3 keepers release the key
to that member's wallet-derived key. Keys are sign-to-derive (a Freighter SEP-53 signature run through HKDF,
per room and per capability), so nothing is stored and a member opens on any device. Highlights:
- **k=5 anonymity floor + live meter:** access is blocked in a set too small to hide in.
- **Discover directory:** a wallet-optional public listing of opt-in rooms by coarse buckets, never an exact
  count and never an access feed.
- **Timing defense (the load-bearing slice):** a member hands the proven access to a relay that records it
  on-chain shuffled with the others in a fixed window, so the on-chain timestamp and order bin to the window,
  not the member's action; approvals are also appended in randomized batches. This is contract-free (the
  access call is permissionless) and was verified on the real prover (members who acted seconds apart land
  within one batch, in shuffled order).
- **Honest residuals (stated in the app, not hidden):** cover scales with concurrent traffic, the on-chain
  record still notes which membership snapshot you proved against (null for a stable member list), and this
  hides you from the room owner, not from the self-hosted operator.

## Bonded Proofs (escrow) — live on testnet
A second direction, motivated by Stellar's Claimable Balances. The research (in `development/`, gitignored)
found that a classic Claimable Balance can't anchor a ZK proof — a Soroban contract can't read one, and a CB
is fully public — so the load-bearing design is a **zkorage-owned, Soroban-native time-locked escrow**: lock
any SEP-41/SAC token until a chosen time, with a revocable self-bond or a non-revocable one-way send, and a
gate-readable `is_locked()` / `get_lock()`. It carries two ZK products, both **LIVE**: a **solvency proof
that dies when you pull your collateral**, and an **anonymous tier that expires at a chosen deadline**.

- **Escrow (testnet):** `CAMQKJKAJTOMT66N5N3E3VIRTN5ACDKV6P3Z2HLYVJHLAVRGJKHZFOXC` (immutable, no admin over
  funds; only a lock's depositor/claimant can move it). Bond token `CCFHRZAP7GYUBNJ4RN7NBZL5GS7Q32F4CIXDTWTTIGPYEDWRIS2TUPA5`
  (a demo "zkUSD"). Two adversarial reviews; 22/22 contract tests. Full record: `contract/deployment.testnet.json → escrow_BP1`.
- **Solvency proof that dies when you pull your collateral (LIVE).** An issuer proves `reserves ≥ supply`
  (the reserve figure stays private, attested by a mock reserve auditor) bound to a revocable escrow lock.
  The **solvency gate** `CDHUG4NFTDIO4HX2MZH3PR77EKYUAU47HVKH4UO2WG7GSKDEF4ABWMLA` (`claim_type=12`) verifies
  the Groth16 proof, binds the proven supply to the live zUSD `total_supply()`, requires the lock owner's
  auth, then reads `escrow.get_lock` **live** on every `is_granted` call — so the grant flips **SOLVENT →
  VOID the instant the issuer un-bonds**. New guest `solvency_predicate` (image `d0a2f137…`, a 173-byte
  journal whose first 61 bytes are byte-identical to the PoR journal). Reviewed across three passes (security
  auditor SOUND + code reviewer Ship-it + a third fix-hunt pass) + **Codex CLEAN**.
- **Anonymous tier that expires at a deadline (LIVE).** A member proves two facts at once, in zero knowledge:
  they are in an enrolled set, and they control a non-revocable bonded lock worth at least the tier floor that
  stays locked past the tier deadline. The proof never reveals which wallet, which lock, or the exact amount,
  so every grant is unlinkable. The **tier gate** `CASSJSBMFDS3BCUBYKXG52SUS7GIHBCHDUM5FGQO4LY5VOWPUPPUFKZP`
  (`claim_type=13`) verifies the Groth16 proof, binds it to the enrolled-member root and a qualifying-set root,
  checks `now < X` (sound because qualifying locks cannot be unbonded early), and rejects a reused nullifier
  (one grant per identity per context). The qualifying-set root is admin-published, and anyone can rebuild it
  from the escrow's public locks to catch a dishonest set (the SDK ships `recomputeQualRoot`). New guest
  `tier_predicate` (image `2671938b…`, a 181-byte journal that extends the membership guest with a second
  Merkle path over the bonded commitment). Security auditor SOUND for a testnet demo + code reviewer pass +
  **Codex CLEAN**. On-chain e2e: three members, three unlinkable grants, a reused nullifier rejected. A stable
  demo accessor (`ed4928c6`) holds a live tier grant you can read without a wallet, next to a live numbers
  panel (qualifying bonds, anonymous grants, the minimum anonymity set).
- **Shipped:** the `/app/bonded` pillar (Overview · My Balances · Deposit · **Prove Solvency** · **Anonymous
  Tier**, frontend **v0.11.0**) with a live ACTIVE→VOID solvency badge; the `backend /escrow/*` +
  `/bonded/solvency/*` + `/bonded/tier/*` REST surface; a 9th `solvency` and 10th `tier` prover kind (gateway +
  GPU worker); SDK/MCP **v0.17.0** (`isSolvent`, `recomputeQualRoot`, key-free). Full record:

## Run the Week-2 slice
```bash
# Contracts (Windows/any): deploy the demo token + the PoR policy to testnet
contract/scripts/deploy_token.sh             # -> .token_id.testnet (+ mint initial supply)
contract/scripts/deploy_policy.sh            # -> .policy_id.testnet (init w/ verifier+token+image_id)

# Backend (fill .env from .env.example: token/policy IDs + SIGNER_SECRET)
cd backend && npm install && npm run dev     # :8787  /supply /prove-reserves /submit /result /mint /burn

# Frontend — issuer dashboard
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev     # Verify on-chain -> ✓ ; Mint -> re-Verify -> ✗ supply mismatch
cd frontend && npx playwright test            # headed Chromium e2e (verify -> mint -> mismatch -> burn -> verify)
```

## Run the Week-1 slice
```bash
# 1) Contract (Windows/any): build + deploy + verify the bundled fixture
contract/scripts/deploy.sh           # deploy to testnet, prints contractId + selector
contract/scripts/measure.sh          # on-chain verify cost

# 2) Prover (on the x86 VM): generate a real proof bundle
#    cd prover && RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -p host   -> proof.txt + bundle.json
#    copy bundle.json to backend/data/bundle.json

# 3) Backend
cd backend && cp .env.example .env && npm install && npm run dev   # :8787

# 4) Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev                          # :5173 -> click "Verify on-chain"
```
